Ideas [features to add after the videos get finished] : 

- Many JSON objects[each one has questions to specific subject] and make the user choose which object we will Fetch the data from .
- Show not all question in the JSON object , just show specific number [e.g. random 10 questions each time ] .
- Randomize the choices of ecah question [don't make at the same all the time].  //hint : use shuffle function .
- Show the result of each question immediatly .
- for each JSON object[subject] may clustered each 30 question together .
